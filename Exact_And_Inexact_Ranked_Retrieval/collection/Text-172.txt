RUSSIA A SENIOR CITIZEN HARDLY ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE OLD

BOLSHEVIKS PASSES PRAVDA BY . BUT IT IS THE CUSTOM IN MOSCOW THESE DAYS

TO SKIP THE IN-BETWEEN BIRTHDAYS AND MARK ONLY THE DECADES . SO IT WAS

LAST WEEK THAT NIKITA SERGEEVICH KHRUSHCHEV'S 69TH BIRTHDAY WAS TOTALLY

IGNORED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY PRESS . EVERYONE WAS WAITING UNTIL NEXT

YEAR, WHEN THEY COULD WANDER DOWN TO RED SQUARE AND CHEER FOR HIS

BIBLICAL ALLOTMENT .
